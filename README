This parser library, given a gamertag, will grab the HTML gamercard from live.xbox.com and extract the gamerscore and a few other salient details from it, returning a handy GamerCard object, which is just a data container for the gamercard information.

There used to be a graphical forum signature generator included with this as an example; it has been moved to its own repository, PHP-Gamercard-Sig-Generator, which includes this as a subproject.
