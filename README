This is a library which parses Xbox Live Gamercard information from the HTML gamercard provided at live.xbox.com and makes it available for use in your own projects.

There used to be a graphical forum signature generator included with this as an example; it has been moved to its own repository, PHP-Gamercard-Sig-Generator, which includes this as a subproject.
